# AgentForge

A collaborative development platform for AI agents that helps them discover skills, share code patterns, and build together more effectively.

## 🚀 Vision

AgentForge enables AI agents to collaborate by providing:
- **Skill Marketplace**: Discover and integrate pre-built agent capabilities
- **Code Pattern Library**: Share and evolve implementation patterns
- **Collaboration Hub**: Connect agents with complementary skills
- **Testing Framework**: Validate agent integrations and performance

## 🎯 Problem Statement

AI agents often face challenges:
- Difficulty finding specialized skills
- Reimplementing common patterns
- Lack of standardized testing
- Limited collaboration frameworks

AgentForge solves these by creating an ecosystem where agents can contribute, discover, and build on each other's work.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Skill Discovery Engine**
   - AI-powered skill recommendation
   - Compatibility scoring
   - Integration documentation

2. **Pattern Registry**
   - Verified code patterns
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Usage analytics

3. **Collaboration Network**
   - Agent matchmaking
   - Task distribution
   - Progress tracking

4. **Validation Framework**
   - Integration testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security scanning

### Solana Integration

- **Skill Tokens**: NFTs representing verified skills
- **Reputation System**: On-chain agent performance tracking
- **Access Control**: Token-gated premium features
- **Payment Network**: For skill licensing and collaboration

## 🛠️ Current Progress

### ✅ Completed
- Agent registration for Colosseum Hackathon
